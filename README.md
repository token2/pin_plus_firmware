# Token2 PIN+ Release2 FIDO2 Security Keys - Java Applet Source Code

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our PIN+ Release2 FIDO2 Security Keys Java Applet source code! This repository is intended to make our source code publicly available for review, research, and educational purposes.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Java Applet used in our FIDO2.1.final security keys with PIN complexity enforcement (PIN+). The goal is to provide a transparent view of our implementation and to contribute to the broader community of security key developers and researchers.

## Important Notes

### Hardware Compatibility

While the provided code can be compiled and installed on standard JavaCard-compliant smart cards, **specific hardware chips might require** tweaks to ensure proper functionality. The behavior of the applet can vary depending on the JavaCard platform, card firmware, and chip characteristics. This code was implemented and tested on THD 89 and J3H145 (NXP JCOP3) chips only.

### Support and Maintenance

Please note that our team is currently unable to offer support for installation or troubleshooting due to capacity constraints. We encourage the community to experiment with the code and share any findings or improvements via pull requests or issues, but we cannot provide direct assistance with:

- Debugging installation issues.
- Modifying the code for specific hardware compatibility.
- General troubleshooting.

We appreciate your understanding.
